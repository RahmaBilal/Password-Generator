# Password-Generator

## Task

This week's Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Task Breakdown


The code is capable of creating a random and secure password with the click of a button. The client is then presented with a series of prompts for a password criteria and they can choose what they would or would not like. (As seen as the bottom of the README file). The client can then choose the length of their password and whether they would like lowercase, uppercase, special characters and numbers


THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
