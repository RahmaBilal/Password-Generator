# Password-Generator

## Task

This week's Challenge requires me to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Task Breakdown


The code is capable of creating a random and secure password with the click of a button. The client is then presented with a series of prompts for a password criteria and they can choose what they would or would not like. (As seen as the bottom of the README file). The client can then choose the length of their password and whether they would like lowercase, uppercase, special characters and numbers. Password is then generated and displayed on the main page.

The following image show that the web application's code:

The following images show that the web application's code is functioning and working well:

This last screenshot shows that all of the criteria is met and the password has been generated.
